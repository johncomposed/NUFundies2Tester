Do you hate Eclipse more than terrible shell scripts? Are you in Northeastern University's cs2510 Fundies 2? Then I have a terrible shell script for you!

You probably shouldn't use this. As of writing this I don't really know how to run java from terminal normally, so I have no clue how or why this works. Open up an issue/pull request if you have any insight and/or made it better.
