# NUFundies2Tester
Do you hate Eclipse more than terrible shell scripts? Are you in Northeastern University's cs2510 Fundies 2? Then I have a terrible shell script for you!

You probably shouldn't use this. As of writing this I know basically nothing about how to run java from terminal normally and I have no clue how or why this works. Only tested on my ubuntu box. 

Usage: `sh tester.sh file.java ExamplesClass`

Open up an issue/pull request if you know why it works and/or made it better! (Seriously, there has to be a better way to do this.)
